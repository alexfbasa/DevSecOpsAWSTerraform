# Security Terms Overview

Welcome to the Security Terms Overview lecture! In this session, we will explore key security terms that will be
integral throughout the course:

## 1. SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

SAST is a white-box testing method that analyzes source code to identify security issues. This can be done manually
through source code checklists or automatically using tools like Fortify, Veracode, and SonarQube.

## 2. Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

SCA, also known as software composition analysis, helps identify third-party libraries used in source code. It
highlights license issues and security vulnerabilities associated with these libraries. Tools like Snyk can automate the
software composition analysis process.

## 3. DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)

DAST involves black-box testing for web and mobile applications using tools such as OWASP ZAP, Veracode DAST, and Web
Inspect. These tools automatically identify security issues within web applications through dynamic testing.

## 4. IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing)

IAST is a blend of SAST and DAST, aiming to overcome limitations in both methods. It scans specific workflows within the
code to identify security issues dynamically.

## 5. Infrastructure as Code (IAC)

IAC involves creating infrastructure using code files. Examples include using CloudFormation templates for AWS or
Terraform for Azure and AWS. IAC security testing focuses on identifying security issues within these code files.

## 6. API Security

API security is the process of identifying security issues within APIs, often referred to as security for microservices.
Understanding the distinction between APIs and microservices is crucial, where microservices are subsets of APIs.

By grasping these security terms, you'll be well-prepared for the practical aspects of the course. Whether manually
inspecting source code or utilizing automated tools, each term plays a vital role in fortifying your understanding of
DevSecOps. Enjoy your learning journey, and let's delve into the practical applications in the upcoming sessions!
