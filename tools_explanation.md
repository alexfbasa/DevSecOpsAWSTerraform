# Tools Explanation

Let's understand the tools mentioned in the development and operations stages of the DevSecOps pipeline:

## Development Stage Tools

### 1. GIT Secrets

- Purpose: Identifies security credentials or personal tokens committed in the source code by mistake.
- Usage: Scans the entire code repository and provides warnings about any security credentials present.
- Impact: Helps developers remove sensitive information committed unintentionally.

### 2. Security Plugins for IDEs

- Purpose: Integrated Development Environment plugins provided by security organizations like fortify, Veracode,
  SonarQube, Snyk.
- Usage: Installed in IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse.
- Impact: Allows developers to identify security issues within the source code during the early stages of software
  development.

### 3. Trufflehog

- Purpose: Similar to GIT Secrets but with enterprise licensing.
- Usage: Scans for sensitive information in the source code.
- Impact: Adds an extra layer of security for identifying unintentional commits.

## Build Pipeline Tools

### 1. SonarQube

- Purpose: Code quality tool widely used for identifying security and code quality issues.
- Impact: Helps organizations maintain high code standards.

### 2. SAST Security Tools

- Tools: Fortify, Veracode, Checkmarx.
- Purpose: Static Application Security Testing.
- Impact: Identifies vulnerabilities in the source code.

### 3. Software Composition Analysis Tools

- Tools: Fortify, Veracode, Blackduck, Snyk.
- Purpose: Identifies third-party libraries and associated security issues.
- Impact: Ensures secure usage of external libraries.

### 4. DAST Tools

- Tools: OWASP Zap, Webinspect, Veracode DAST, Acunetix.
- Purpose: Dynamic Application Security Testing for web and mobile applications.
- Impact: Identifies security issues in running applications.

### 5. Infrastructure as Code (IAC) Security Tools

- Tools: Bridgecrew, Snyk.
- Purpose: Scans IAC files (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) for configuration issues.
- Impact: Ensures secure cloud infrastructure deployment.

### 6. Container Security Tools

- Tools: Aqua, Qualys, PrismaCloud.
- Purpose: Identifies security issues within containers.
- Impact: Ensures containerized applications are secure.

## Operations Stage Tools

### 1. Build Pipeline Tools

- Tools: Jenkins, AWS CodeBuild, GCP Cloudbuild, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, GitLab.
- Purpose: Create and manage DevSecOps pipelines.
- Impact: Orchestrates the continuous integration and delivery process.

### 2. Cloud Security Posture Management Tools

- Tools: Aqua, BridgeCrew.
- Purpose: Identifies and resolves configuration issues within cloud infrastructure.
- Impact: Ensures adherence to cloud security standards.

### 3. Container Registry Scanning Tools

- Tools: Aqua, AWS Native Registry scanning.
- Purpose: Scans containers within container registries for security issues.
- Impact: Adds a layer of security for containerized applications.

### 4. Infrastructure Scanning Tools

- Tools: Chef Inspect, Nessus (Tenable).
- Purpose: Scans infrastructure for compliance and security issues.
- Impact: Ensures infrastructure meets security standards.

### 5. Cloud Security Tools

- Tools: AWS Security Hub, Azure Defender.
- Purpose: Native cloud tools for identifying security issues.
- Impact: Monitors and secures cloud environments.

These tools collectively contribute to building a robust DevSecOps pipeline, ensuring security at every stage of
development and operations.

### 6. S3 Bucket (Artifact Storage)

- Purpose: Centralized storage for build artifacts.
- Usage: Configure AWS CodeBuild to store artifacts in an S3 bucket.
- Impact: Enhances security and accessibility of build artifacts, facilitating integration with other AWS services.

### 7. Amazon VPC endpoint.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to effectively utilize Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) connectivity in the context of
AWS CodeCommit and CodeBuild. VPC integration becomes crucial when you need to access resources within a specific VPC
from your CodeBuild environment.

Why VPC Integration?
AWS CodeBuild projects often require access to resources within a VPC, such as databases or other internal services. VPC
integration ensures secure communication between your CodeBuild environment and the resources residing in the VPC.
