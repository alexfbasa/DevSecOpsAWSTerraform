# Tools Explanation

Let's understand the tools mentioned in the development and operations stages of the DevSecOps pipeline:

## Development Stage Tools

### 1. GIT Secrets

- Purpose: Identifies security credentials or personal tokens committed in the source code by mistake.
- Usage: Scans the entire code repository and provides warnings about any security credentials present.
- Impact: Helps developers remove sensitive information committed unintentionally.

### 2. Security Plugins for IDEs

- Purpose: Integrated Development Environment plugins provided by security organizations like fortify, Veracode,
  SonarQube, Snyk.
- Usage: Installed in IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse.
- Impact: Allows developers to identify security issues within the source code during the early stages of software
  development.

### 3. Trufflehog

- Purpose: Similar to GIT Secrets but with enterprise licensing.
- Usage: Scans for sensitive information in the source code.
- Impact: Adds an extra layer of security for identifying unintentional commits.

## Build Pipeline Tools

### 1. SonarQube

- Purpose: Code quality tool widely used for identifying security and code quality issues.
- Impact: Helps organizations maintain high code standards.

### 2. SAST Security Tools

- Tools: Fortify, Veracode, Checkmarx.
- Purpose: Static Application Security Testing.
- Impact: Identifies vulnerabilities in the source code.

### 3. Software Composition Analysis Tools

- Tools: Fortify, Veracode, Blackduck, Snyk.
- Purpose: Identifies third-party libraries and associated security issues.
- Impact: Ensures secure usage of external libraries.

### 4. DAST Tools

- Tools: OWASP Zap, Webinspect, Veracode DAST, Acunetix.
- Purpose: Dynamic Application Security Testing for web and mobile applications.
- Impact: Identifies security issues in running applications.

### 5. Infrastructure as Code (IAC) Security Tools

- Tools: Bridgecrew, Snyk.
- Purpose: Scans IAC files (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) for configuration issues.
- Impact: Ensures secure cloud infrastructure deployment.

### 6. Container Security Tools

- Tools: Aqua, Qualys, PrismaCloud.
- Purpose: Identifies security issues within containers.
- Impact: Ensures containerized applications are secure.

## Operations Stage Tools

### 1. Build Pipeline Tools

- Tools: Jenkins, AWS CodeBuild, GCP Cloudbuild, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, GitLab.
- Purpose: Create and manage DevSecOps pipelines.
- Impact: Orchestrates the continuous integration and delivery process.

### 2. Cloud Security Posture Management Tools

- Tools: Aqua, BridgeCrew.
- Purpose: Identifies and resolves configuration issues within cloud infrastructure.
- Impact: Ensures adherence to cloud security standards.

### 3. Container Registry Scanning Tools

- Tools: Aqua, AWS Native Registry scanning.
- Purpose: Scans containers within container registries for security issues.
- Impact: Adds a layer of security for containerized applications.

### 4. Infrastructure Scanning Tools

- Tools: Chef Inspect, Nessus (Tenable).
- Purpose: Scans infrastructure for compliance and security issues.
- Impact: Ensures infrastructure meets security standards.

### 5. Cloud Security Tools

- Tools: AWS Security Hub, Azure Defender.
- Purpose: Native cloud tools for identifying security issues.
- Impact: Monitors and secures cloud environments.

These tools collectively contribute to building a robust DevSecOps pipeline, ensuring security at every stage of
development and operations.
