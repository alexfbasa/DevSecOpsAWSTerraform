# DevSecOps AWS and Terraform laboratory

Welcome to the DevSecOps AWS and Terraform laboratory! In this hands-on journey, we will be leveraging various AWS
native services to implement a robust DevSecOps pipeline. Follow the steps below to get started:

## Step 1: Create an AWS Account

Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have an AWS account. Follow the necessary steps provided by AWS to set
up your account.

## Step 2: Install Git Bash

Git Bash is a crucial tool for managing your source code. Install Git Bash on your Windows machine to proceed with the
upcoming steps.

## Step 3: Connect Git Bash with AWS Code Commit

AWS Code Commit, similar to GitHub, is your private repository. Connect Git Bash with AWS Code Commit to seamlessly push
your vulnerable application to the repository.

## Step 4: Implement BuildSpec YAML File

Create a BuildSpec YAML file to establish a build pipeline or DevSecOps pipeline within AWS. This file is essential for
the subsequent steps.

## Step 5: Create a SonarCloud Account

Set up a SonarCloud account and integrate it with the BuildSpec YAML file. This integration will pave the way for a
secure pipeline within AWS, a crucial step in implementing DevSecOps.

## Step 6: Populate Code Coverage in SonarCloud

Learn how to populate code coverage within SonarCloud, addressing real-life scenarios and sharing insights gained from
experience.

## Step 7: Optimize Pipeline Security

Move security tokens from the YAML file to AWS Secrets Manager for enhanced pipeline security. Ensure that no
confidential information resides in the pipeline.

## Step 8: Implement Quality Gates for Sonar Cloud

Enhance your DevSecOps pipeline by implementing Quality Gates for SonarCloud. These gates will ensure that the build
fails if security standards are not met.

## Step 9: Integrate Software Composition Analysis

Add a layer of security by implementing software composition analysis within your AWS DevSecOps pipeline.

## Step 10: Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

Explore the concept of CSPM, a crucial aspect of automated security in cloud environments. Implement a tool to scan your
AWS infrastructure for configuration issues.

## Step 11: Implement Native AWS Security Services

Familiarize yourself with native AWS security services, essential for securing your cloud environment. Gain practical
insights into implementing these services.

## Step 12: Commitment to Implementation

Commit to implementing each tool integrated into our CI/CD pipeline. Embrace the hands-on nature of this laboratory to
become proficient in deploying a DevSecOps pipeline within AWS for an enterprise environment.
